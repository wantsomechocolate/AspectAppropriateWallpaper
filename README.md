AspectAppropriateWallpaper
==========================

Automatically change your desktop image when switching between portrait and landscape mode.

This program has only been tested on a Lenovo X200 Tablet running windows 7. 

I used py2exe to create a windows executable and then put a shorcut for that program into my startup
folder so that whenever I switch between landscape and portrait mode an appropiately proportioned image
is used as the background. 

Currently the image paths are set in stone, maybe I'll make the program ask the first time where the user
wants to retrieve the image files from. 

Thank you for reading the README.
