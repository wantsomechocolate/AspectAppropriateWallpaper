SmartWallpaper
==========================

Automatically change your desktop image when switching between portrait and landscape mode.

This program has only been tested on a Lenovo X200 Tablet running windows 7. 

I used py2exe to create a windows executable and then put a shorcut for that program into my startup
folder so that whenever I switch between landscape and portrait mode an appropiately proportioned image
is used as the background. 

Currently the image path is set in the code, change them to a location that contains images. 

when the program starts it will go through all the images in the directory you told it to and check to see which ones would work for portrait and which for landscape.

Thank you for reading the README.
